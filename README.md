![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isage/septerra-core-vita/master/sce_sys/pic0.png)

This port is based on [SR project](https://github.com/M-HT/SR)  
That means it's a [statically recompiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_translation) binary with specific parts re-implemented with posix/vita compatibility.


## Running

* Instal latest vpk from [releases](https://github.com/isage/septerra-core-vita/releases)
* Copy data from your legally obtained GOG copy of the game into `ux0:/data/septerra/`
